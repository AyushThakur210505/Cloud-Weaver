# Cloud-Weaver
A full-stack developer tool that enables engineers to visually map out cloud infrastructure. By parsing complex network relationships from an interactive 2D canvas into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), the engine automatically resolves dependencies and generates production-ready, syntax-perfect Terraform and AWS CloudFormation scripts.
